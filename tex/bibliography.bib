abstract="This paper concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image stitching. Though the 1D problem (single axis of rotation) is well studied, 2D or multi-row stitching is more difficult. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use invariant local features to find matches between all of the images. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also insensitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In addition to providing more detail, this paper extends our previous work in the area (Brown and Lowe, 2003) by introducing gain compensation and automatic straightening steps.",

@TechReport {Szeliski2004,
abstract     = {This tutorial reviews image alignment and image stitching algorithms. Image
                alignment (registration) algorithms can discover the large-scale (parametric)
                correspondence relationships among images with varying degrees of overlap. They
                are ideally suited for applications such as video stabilization, summarization,
                and the creation of large-scale panoramic photographs. Image stitching algorithms
                take the alignment estimates produced by such registration algorithms and blend
                the images in a seamless manner, taking care to deal with potential problems such
                as blurring or ghosting caused by parallax and scene movement as well as varying
                image exposures. This tutorial reviews the basic motion models underlying
                alignment and stitching algorithms, describes effective direct (pixel-based) and
                feature-based alignment algorithms, and describes blending algorithms used to
                produce seamless mosaics. It closes with a discussion of open research problems
                in the area.},

@Inproceedings {Shum1998,
abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach to computing depth maps from a large
                collection of images where the camera motion has been constrained to planar
                concentric circles. We resample the resulting collection of regular perspective
                images into a set of multiperspective panoramas, and then compute depth maps
                directly from these resampled images. Only a small number of multiperspective
                panoramas is needed to obtain a dense and accurate 3D reconstruction, since our
                panoramas sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial
                distance, and vertical elevation. Using multiperspective panoramas avoids the
                limited overlap between the original input images that causes problems in
                conventional multi-baseline stereo. Our approach differs from stereo matching of
                panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints
                are sine curves. For our multiperspective panoramas, the epipolar geometry, to
                first order, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo
                algorithm can be applied to multiperspective panoramas without modification.
                Experimental results show that our approach generates good depth maps that can be
                used for image-based rendering tasks such as view interpolation and
                extrapolation.},
