This work has focused on map-merging of two-dimensional maps. Map-merging for tree-dimensional maps is a challenging problem in robotics. Despite two-dimensional maps are still routinely used for navigation in systems using tree-dimensional \gls{SLAM} algorithms, tree-dimensional maps are becoming more common in robotics. While two-dimensional maps may provide a better overview for a human eye, three-dimensional maps contain more information and therefore might provide better accuracy for map-merging. A hybrid solution capable working with both two-dimensional and tree-dimensional maps might bring the best from both worlds together.

Although the merging algorithm has been partially evaluated on data captured by a PR2 robot, online properties of the merging algorithm has been evaluated only in the simulator. Evaluation with physical robots is yet to be done; building a multi-robot exploring system is purposely out of scope of this work. However I expect performance for real-world applications to be comparable to the experiments in the simulator or even better, because indoor physical environments are usually more feature-rich than scenarios in the simulator.
